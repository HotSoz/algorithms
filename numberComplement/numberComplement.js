/*************************************** Number Complement *******************************************
* 
* Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
* 
* Example 1:
* 
* Input: num = 5
* Output: 2
* Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
* 
* Example 2:
* 
* Input: num = 1
* Output: 0
* Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
*  
* 
* Constraints:
* 
* The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* num >= 1
* You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
*
